# F-statistics course

These are the continuously updated course materials covering F-statistics _sensu_ Patterson (2012). I have used this material at the [Copenhagen Population Genetics Summer School](http://popgen.dk/popgen22/) organized by Ida Moltke, Anders Albrechtsen and Fernando Racimo, and the [EMBO Course in Population Genomics](https://embo-popgen.centercongressi.com/home.php) organized by Chiara Batini, Vincenza Colonna and Andrea Manica.
